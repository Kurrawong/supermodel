==== Component Models

_Component Models_ are implemented for each Dataset within this scenario's scope. So far, a few Datasets are known to be within scope and these are given in <<#fig-level-3-datasets, Figure 7>>.

==== Overarching Model

For this Supermodel scenario, a fairly succinct overarching model that contains the _Main Classes_ of each of the _Component Models_ can be implemented since there is not a large number of Datasets for which _Component Models_ are needed. <<#fig-level-3-overview, Figure 8>> presents this overarching model.
